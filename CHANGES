CHANGES file for project GPSDisplay
============================================================================

Garmin GPS25-LVC strings:
-------------------------
- $PGRMO,GPGSV,0
- $PGRMIE


ToDo:
-----
- GPS data quality display (via yellow LED/blinking)
- reduce memory consumption of some calculations/conversion routines
- avoid display of speed/course if we are not moving (speed gradient)
- compress information in display, i.e. make more info visible at one time
- support 4 lines LCD display, for instance ...


Version v1r1: (not yet tagged)
-------------

2009/08/13 (thjm) - 'No GPS signal !' eventually displayed (first step)
                  - position data display disabled as long as not 'kValidData'
		  - memory initialisation scheme for string struct changed
		  - $GPVTG sentence evaluation for speed/course data added

2009/08/12 (thjm) - put all text constants inside flash
                  - bug in HDOP display fixed (?)

Version v1r0:
-------------

2009/08/11 (thjm) - fixed another bug with Navilocks data format
                  - added N4TXIs Serial.h/Serial.c files
		    + using it
		    - functions renamed to resemble filename
		    - SerialPutString_p() for PROGMEM strings added

2009/08/10 (thjm) - continuing development with Navilock NL-303P module...
                    - '°' sign now OK for LCD
		    - HDOP display added
		    - removed leading '0's in degrees display
		    - fixed bugs in lat/lon seconds display
		    - time filled is longer -> special treatment required
		    - fixed locator calculation, was b...shit !
		    - fixed char array sizes
		    - enabled speed/course display
		  - gpssim.cc: a program to provide valid NMEA-strings for sim.

2009/07/24 (thjm) - imported get8key4.* (P.Dannegger) 
                  - checking push button to advance LCD display mode
		    - this uses counter1 which is also used in WhereAVR
		  - LcdDisplay.* -> LCDDisplay.*

2009/07/23 (thjm) - added a few (unnecessary !?) more gimicks to the code
                  - compile time option to use N4TXIs Serial.* module (inact.)

2009/07/21 (thjm) - wiring for LCD finally OK:
                    - one display turns out to be 2x1x8 (=1x16)
		    - second one has probably defective rows (=2x16)
		    
2009/07/16 (thjm) - wiring scheme for PC-GPS-AVRTracker adaptor:

                     PC (DTE)                           GPS (DCE) 
		    ----------                         -----------
		     RxD (2,gn) ----------------------- RxD (3,ye)
		     TxD (3,ye) ----------------+ +---- TxD (2,ye)
		     GND (5,bn) --------------*-------- GND (5,bn)
		                              | | |
		                              | | |     AVR (DCE)
					      | | |    -----------
					      | | +---- RxD (3,ye)
					      | +------ TxD (2,gn)
					      +-------- GND (5,bn)

                  - test program for the LCD added (testLCD.c)
		  - worked on Makefile (pattern rules)
		  
2009/07/15 (thjm) - added (optional) writing to file of NMEA strings

2009/07/10 (thjm) - SConstruct splitted into SConscript
                    + extra build directory
		  - Clean() target to removed .build directory for 'scons -c'
		  - AVR implementation added:
		    - Makefile is for AVR (similar to WhereAVR)
		    - GPSDisplay.c contains the main() for the AVR
		    - using LCD code of P.Fleury
		    - using UART code of P.Fleury for GPS comms
		      -> tbd: replace by code of N4TXI
		  - more text into file README
		  - PC programs sleeps a bit if no characters available

2009/07/08 (thjm) - current functionality:
                    - reading and parsing NMEA strings
		    - simulation of LCD display
		    - display most strings correctly on sim. LCD display
		    
2009/07/01 (thjm) - start of project
