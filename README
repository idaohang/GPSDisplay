README file for project GPSDisplay
============================================================================

This is the project GPSDisplay. The initial goal of the project is to
have a similar device like the one described in FA 4/09 pg. 403.

The original device is based on a PIC 18F252 and uses a Navilock NL-504ETTL or
NL-501ETTL (Sirf3) as GPS module. By pressing a button one can schange the
text displayed at the LCD between different display modes.
