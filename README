README file for project GPSDisplay
============================================================================

This is the project GPSDisplay. The initial goal of the project is to
have a similar device like the one described in FA 4/09 pg. 403 [1].

The original device is based on a PIC 18F252 and uses a Navilock NL-504ETTL or
NL-501ETTL (Sirf3) as GPS module. By pressing a button one can schange the
text displayed at the LCD between different display modes.

The GPS decoding routines stem mainly from the WhereAVR project of G.Dion 
(N4TXI) - see also ref. [2].

The LCD routines are taken from the library of P.Fleury [3].

The used GPS module is a Garmin GOS25-LVC (12-channel receiver) [4].
